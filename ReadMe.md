## Description

This software is a nodal editor that allow you to create sounds from several generators (sine wave, square wave, etc.) 
and modulate them (frequency, amplitude, etc.) and modify them (delay, repeat, etc.).

**This is currently in alpha version.**<br>
It still lack of common features (copy/paste, undo/redo, etc.) and components (there a lot more to be done).
But the software is fully functionnaland have all the core features.

**There is currently only Windows 8/10 builds**<br>
If you want this software on other platform, please download Qt and build it yourself.<br>
You can also contribute by providing your build to share it with other people.

## Controls
Press any buttons from the left side to add a component in the scene.<br>

You can select components with `mouse left button` and drag them around the scene.<br>
You can delete selected components with `right click > remove` or by pressing  `delete`.<br>
(note that the output component cannot be removed)<br>

Press a component pin with `left mouse button` and hold it until you release it  on another pin.<br>
An output pin cannot be connected to another output pin (same for input pins), and you cannot connect components in a loop.<br>

In order to play a sound, you have to generate it with the menu `Audio > Generate` or by pressing `F5`.


## Features
- Base sound signals : Sinus, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth, Random (White noise);
- Mix sound signals with operators like Add, Multiply;
- Modify sound signals with Delay, Repeat and ADSR;
- Save and load editor projects;
- Save resulting sound in wav file.
